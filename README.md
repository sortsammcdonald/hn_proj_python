I have a basic script that asks the user for their user name and returns a URL, clickable in the console. Not much but it's a start.

Would be good if I could account for what happens if someone enters an invalid user name. I'm not really doing anything with the API though. Would be good if I could check if the username is valid by having the programme return a warning if it's not Response 200.

I have made much progress but I feel this code is getting rather unweildy.

Another attempt at the HN API project, but this time with Python.

I've created the basic structure the code should follow. I just need to write the code now...
